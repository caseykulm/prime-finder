# Prime Finder

Fun project to test out different methods for finding prime numbers

## Implemented methods

### SimplePrimality

Follows some of the ideas listed in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test#Simple_methods 
but simplifies the last step a bit.

### AksPrimality

Follows https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test which is much more efficient, and
was very important theoretically, but is not the go to fast primality test used these days.
